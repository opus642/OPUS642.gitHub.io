I"Ù<p>Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 â€“ 21 January 1950), known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English, essayist, journalist and critic. His work is characterised by lucid prose, biting social criticism, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism.
Orwellâ€™s work remains influential in popular culture and in political culture, and the adjective â€œOrwellianâ€â€”describing totalitarian and authoritarian social practicesâ€”is part of the English language, like many of his neologisms, such as â€œBig Brotherâ€, â€œThought Policeâ€, â€œTwo Minutes Hateâ€, â€œRoom 101â€, â€œmemory holeâ€, â€œNewspeakâ€, â€œdoublethinkâ€, â€œprolesâ€, â€œunpersonâ€, and â€œthoughtcrimeâ€.</p>
