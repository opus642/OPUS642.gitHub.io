    <h1>George Orwell</h1>
<h2>writer</h2>

<p>Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English, essayist, journalist and critic. His work is characterised by lucid prose, biting social criticism, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism.
Orwell’s work remains influential in popular culture and in political culture, and the adjective “Orwellian”—describing totalitarian and authoritarian social practices—is part of the English language, like many of his neologisms, such as “Big Brother”, “Thought Police”, “Two Minutes Hate”, “Room 101”, “memory hole”, “Newspeak”, “doublethink”, “proles”, “unperson”, and “thoughtcrime”.</p>
